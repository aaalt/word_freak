# TODO
- [x] !!! reorganize main algorithm (txt parsing should work for trie)


- [x] main algorithm
- [ ] my own implementation of hash table
- [x] my own implementation of trie 
- [x] text processing 
- [ ] understand the whole org/

## main algorithm 
- [ ] trace *(th.)
- [x] set (th.)
- [x] txt (th.)
- [x] cfg (th.)
- [x] everything works 

## hash table 
- [ ] hsh.c hsh.h
- [ ] everything works 

## trie 
- [x] tri.c tri.h
- [x] everything works 

## text processing 
- [x] txt.c txt.h (th.)
- [x] everything works
- [X] reorganize parsing

* *th. means that hypothetically it should work
