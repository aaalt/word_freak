# TODO

new tasks:

- [ ] reorganize parsing
- [ ] reorganize everything for UTF-8 encoding of input files
--------------------

- [x] reorganize main algorithm (txt parsing should work for trie)


- [x] main algorithm
- [x] my own implementation of hash table
- [x] my own implementation of trie 
- [x] text processing 
- [x] understand the whole org/

## main algorithm 
- [x] trace *(th.)
- [x] set (th.)
- [x] txt (th.)
- [x] cfg (th.)
- [x] everything works 

## hash table 
- [x] hsh.c hsh.h
- [x] everything works 

## trie 
- [x] tri.c tri.h
- [x] everything works 

## text processing 
- [x] txt.c txt.h (th.)
- [x] everything works
- [X] reorganize parsing

## understand the whole org/
- [x] bag.c bag.h
- [x] clk.c clk.h
- [x] rnd.c rnd.h
- [x] tri.c tri.h
- [x] hsh.c hsh.h
- [x] trc.c trc.h
- [x] vec.c vec.h
- [x] \___.h



* *th. means that hypothetically it should work
